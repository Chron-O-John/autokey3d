== General ==

This directory contains profile data in SVG format.

For each SVG profile, an optional tolerance file can be added to specify a
material strength that should be removed when transforming the SVG into a key.

This tolerance depends on the process of the profile extraction. If the profile
has been extracted from a keyway picture, then a tolerance of 0.2 (rarely 0.15 
or 0.25) is good. If the profile has been extracted from a key or a profile
trace representing the key, then a 0.0 tolerance (default) should be used.

The format of the files should be:

X-Y.svg for the profile and X-Y.tol for the respective tolerance file, where

X is the brand name (e.g. ABUS)
Y is the profile name (e.g. AB1) if known, or the lock type if unknown.
